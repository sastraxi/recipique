# Recipique: cooking for developers

Recipique aims to be a number of things:

* a recipe website with a "cooking mode" that estimates how long each step will take
* a directed graph through steps (nodes); a walk through this graph will yield a set of recipes that differ only by ingredients, quantities, and temperatures (but not by technique)
* a jumping-off point for improvisation and substitution; discover similar recipes by ingredient and step similarity

Currently, it is none of those things. It's just a simple `create-react-app` / apollo server mashup.
